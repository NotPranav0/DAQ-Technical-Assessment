CAN
Q1:

Advantages
- Robustness & Error Handling: More reliable in harsh environments than simpler protocols like SPI or I2C due to differential signals and CRC.  
- Multi-Master & Arbitration: Unlike USB (host-centric), CAN allows every node to initiate communication without corrupting data.  
- Long-Distance: PCIe and SPI are usually short-range; CAN extends across vehicles or industrial plants effectively.  
- Deterministic Latency: Great for real-time control, unlike USB’s host polling model or I2C’s slower speeds.

Disadvantages
- Lower Data Rates: Can’t match USB 3.x or PCIe for bandwidth-intensive applications. Even SPI can run faster on short PCB traces.  
- Small Payloads: CAN restricts frames to 8 bytes, while USB and PCIe can transfer large packets easily.  
- Complex: While CAN is certainly less complex than USB or PCIe, SPI/I2C are more straightforward and cheaper than CAN if you only have a few short-distance sensors.  

Q2:

Embedded Systems pressumable have multiple microcontrollers distributed around the vehicle which require robust, real-time communication over longer distances. CAN offers a multi-master bus with differential signaling and built-in error handling, ensuring reliable operation in a harsh racing environment. SPI/I2C are fine for short on-board links but scale poorly to multi-node vehicle networks, while USB is host-centric and not ideal for peer-to-peer embedded control.

The powertrain environment has inductive loads and high electromagnetic interference, requiring a noise-immune communication system. Its differential signaling and CRC-based error detection effectively mitigate noise, ensuring stable data exchange among sensors and actuators.SPI and I2C have no robust noise-handling or retransmission mechanisms, and USB/PCIe are not typically designed for severe automotive EMI.

The DAQ department have a large numbers of sensors distributed across the vehicle which demand moderate-to-high bandwidth with dependable data integrity. CAN provides the neccessary throughput while preserving the robust error detection and correction essential for race telemetry. SPI/I2C are short-range without automatic error-handling, USB is host-driven (less flexible for multi-node setups), and PCIe is overkill in cost/complexity for typical sensor data.

The AV pressumably have safety-critical control loops and sensor fusion which require deterministic real-time communication with priority-based message handling. CAN's hardware-level arbitration ensures urgent messages (e.g., fault alerts) preempt lower-priority data for guaranteed response times. USB relies on host polling, SPI is single-master, and PCIe’s high-speed point-to-point architecture lacks simple broadcast-based priority arbitration.

STM32 Chip Selection

Using the filters on the STM product selector, there are 21 chips that meet the given requirements
I've narrowed down the selection by filtering for the following criteria:
- Maximum Operating Temperature: Highest available at 105°C. There are chips rated for 85°C, but a higher maximum rating is probably more suitable for automotive applications.
- Package: LQFP (Assuming the board is hand-soldered). There are also BGA, but LQFP is more DIY-friendly.
- Numer of SPI interfaces: Highest available at 6. This is to ensure there are enough SPI interfaces for the sensors and actuators.

This narrows it down to 3 chips, the differences between them are:
|             |         |                |                      |               |                             |          |        |
|-------------|---------|----------------|----------------------|---------------|-----------------------------|----------|--------|
| STM32F76511 | 140 I/O |                |                      |               | Additonal Security Features | In Stock | $20.64 |
| STM32F765Zl | 114 I/O |                | Graphics Accelerator |               | Additonal Security Features | In Stock | $20.10 |
| STM32F77711 | 140 I/O | TFT Controller |                      | Crypto Engine | /                           |          | $26.03 |


I would pick the STM32F76511 for its extra I/O pins and lower price compared to the STM32F77711. 
The graphics accelerator and TFT controller on the other chips are not necessary for the given application,
and the crypto engine is likely overkill for a racing vehicle. 
The additional security features are a nice bonus, but not probably not critical for this use case.

Dimensions:
LQFP footpint, 176 pins, 24x24mm, 0.5mm pitch

Power Consumption:
Maximum ratings:
- V_dd = 4V
- I_dd = 420mA
Theoretical maximum power consumption:
- P = V_dd * I_dd = 4V * 420mA = 1.68W

Not a realistic value, as it assumes all pins are sourcing/sinking current at their maximum ratings.
STM does provide comprehensive typical power consumption values in the datasheet.

Assuming a nominal operating voltage of 3.3V, an operting temperature of 85°C,
and a scenario where all peripherals are active and the CPU is running at its maximum clock speed,
with code running from flash memory and 20 I/O pins toggling at 8Mhz, with a high capacitance load (33pF),
the current consumption is estimated to be around 312mA.
- P = V_dd * I_dd = 3.3V * 312mA = 1.03W
(page 120 and page 128 of the datasheet)
